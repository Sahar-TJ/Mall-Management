# Mall-Management

A school project based on the topic Management System. The students were required to make a C++ program.
I chose to build a Mall Management System, that can help target oriented customers to locate their desired shop. 
Since the malls can be huge and people may get lost. This Program stores information/ data of shops present in the mall.
Data includes Name, Shop Number and Timings.

The Program itself is categorised into 2, Admin and Customer.
Admin gives access to the administration who have to log in by using a username and password.
Choosing the 'Customer' option will again ask for a username and password which is different from the Admin one.
Here the Customer gets to view information about all the shops. He/She can search a specific shop as well.
